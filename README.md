# Music Theory Tool Manual

## Quick Start
This interactive application helps you explore music theory concepts, generate chord progressions, and understand harmonic relationships.

## Basic Features

### Interactive Keyboard
* **Playing Notes**: 
  * Click keys with mouse
  * Use computer keyboard (A-L keys for lower octave)
  * Visual feedback shows active notes and scale context

### Main Controls
* **Scale Selection**: Choose from major, minor, and exotic scales
* **Key Selection**: Select any root note
* **Mood Selection**: Generate progressions based on different emotional qualities
* **Complementary Keys**: Shows the fifth up and fourth down for modulation

### Visual Color System
* **Pink**: Root note of your selected key
* **Teal**: Notes in the current scale
* **Purple**: Fifth up (dominant relationship)
* **Orange**: Fourth down (subdominant relationship)
* **Blue**: Currently playing note

## Theory Concepts

### Scale Construction
The tool visualizes how scales are built from your chosen root note. Observe how different scale types create distinct patterns of whole and half steps:
* Major scale: W-W-H-W-W-W-H
* Natural minor: W-H-W-W-H-W-W
* Other scales have unique patterns giving them their characteristic sound

### Circle of Fifths Navigation
* The purple highlighted note shows your dominant (fifth up)
* The orange highlighted note shows your subdominant (fourth down)
* Use these for:
  * Understanding key relationships
  * Planning modulations
  * Creating stronger cadences

## Chord Progression Generator

### Mode Options
1. **Basic Triads**
   * Three-note chords
   * All notes in same octave
   * Clear, fundamental harmonies

2. **Seventh Chords**
   * Adds seventh above triad
   * More colorful sound
   * Standard in jazz progressions

3. **Extended Chords**
   * 9th and 11th extensions
   * Rich, complex harmonies
   * Great for modern styles

4. **Complex Mode**
   * Introduces borrowed chords
   * Uses chromatic variations
   * Creates unexpected turns

### Mood Selection
* Happy: Major-key progressions with strong resolutions
* Sad: Minor-key and descending patterns
* Mysterious: Uses unconventional chord relationships
* Epic: Strong movements with dramatic changes
* Romantic: Smooth voice leading with emotional shifts
* Melancholic: Minor keys with nostalgic patterns
* Dreamy: Extended harmonies with ambiguous resolutions
* Tense: Dissonant relationships and unresolved tensions
* Peaceful: Gentle progressions with stable harmonies

## Adapting The Tool's Output

### Understanding Voicings
The tool generates linear voicings that you can adapt for different musical contexts:

#### Close Position
```
Original: C E G (all in same octave)
Use when: 
- Accompanying vocals
- Need clear, compact sound
- Playing with other instruments
```

#### Open Position
```
Example: C (low) - G - E (high)
Use when:
- Solo piano
- Need fuller sound
- More space in arrangement
```

#### Drop Voicings
```
Drop 2: Take second note from top, lower by octave
Original: C E G B
Drop 2: C G B E
Use in: Jazz comping, guitar arrangements
```

### Creative Applications

#### Practice Techniques
1. Generate a progression in your chosen mood
2. Practice it using different approaches:
   * Block chords
   * Broken (arpeggiated)
   * Bass line with upper structure
   * Different rhythmic patterns

#### Style Adaptations

**Pop/Rock**
* Keep voicings simple and clear
* Emphasize root and fifth
* Use rhythmic patterns
* Stay mostly in root position

**Jazz**
* Use extended harmonies
* Experiment with drop voicings
* Add passing chords
* Explore alterations

**Classical**
* Focus on voice leading
* Use inversions for smooth bass lines
* Create melodic interest in all voices
* Balance texture across register

**Ambient/Modern**
* Spread voicings widely
* Remove certain chord tones
* Use sustain creatively
* Create ambiguous harmonies

### Voice Leading Tips
* Connect common tones between chords
* Move voices to nearest available notes
* Create smooth bass lines through inversions
* Balance voice movement with stability

## Advanced Usage

### Modulation Techniques
1. Use the fifth up (purple) for dominant modulation
2. Use fourth down (orange) for subdominant modulation
3. Try generating progressions in complementary keys
4. Connect progressions through common chords

### Chord Substitutions
* Replace V with VII diminished
* Use relative minor/major relationships
* Explore chromatic mediants
* Try secondary dominants

## Final Notes

Remember that this tool is meant to inspire and educate. The generated progressions are starting points â€“ real musicality comes from how you adapt and use these ideas in your own playing. Experiment with different voicings, rhythms, and adaptations to find what works best for your musical vision.

Use the visual feedback of the keyboard to understand theoretical relationships, but let your ear be the final judge of what sounds right for your music.
