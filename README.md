# Sierra's Theory: Complete User Guide

## Getting Started

Sierra's Theory runs directly in your web browser with no installation required. The app is designed to be intuitive and responsive, working on both desktop and mobile devices.

Key features:
- Interactive keyboard for note visualization
- 14 scale types including major, minor, modes, and more
- Chord progression generator with multiple templates
- Real-time audio playback
- Circle of fifths/fourths integration
- Progression history for tracking your ideas

## Understanding the Interface

The interface is divided into three main sections:

### 1. Keyboard
A virtual piano keyboard that visualizes scales and allows you to play notes. Keys are color-coded:
- Root notes (Pink/Red)
- Scale notes (Green)
- Circle of 5ths (Purple)
- Circle of 4ths (Orange)

### 2. Settings
Configure your musical parameters including:
- Scale selection
- Base key
- Sound type (sine wave, piano, organ)

### 3. Progression Generator
Create and customize chord progressions with options for:
- Progression types (basic, common, jazz, random, etc.)
- Number of chords
- Extended chord types (7th, 9th, 11th)

On mobile devices, these sections are accessible through tabs at the top of the screen.

## Scales and Key Settings

The app offers an extensive collection of scales to experiment with:

- Major
- Minor (Natural)
- Harmonic Minor
- Melodic Minor
- Dorian
- Phrygian
- Lydian
- Mixolydian
- Locrian
- Whole Tone
- Diminished
- Pentatonic Major
- Pentatonic Minor
- Blues

### Understanding Relationships

When you change scales or keys, the app automatically:
- Updates the keyboard visualization
- Shows you the "Up 5th Key" and "Down 4th Key" (helpful for modulation)
- Adjusts any generated progressions to the new key

Experiment with different scales to hear how they change the emotional quality of your progressions. For example:
- Major scales tend to sound bright and happy
- Minor scales often sound sad or melancholic
- Modal scales like Dorian and Mixolydian have distinctive flavors used in many genres
- Pentatonic scales work well for creating simple, catchy melodies

## Generating Chord Progressions

The chord progression generator generates progressions and lists notes

### Progression Types

- **Basic (I-IV-V)**: The foundation of countless songs across genres
- **Common (I-VI-IV-V)**: A popular progression in modern pop music
- **Extended (I-III-VI-IV)**: Offers more emotional movement
- **Circle of 5ths (VI-II-V-I)**: Common in jazz and classical music
- **Jazz (II-V-I)**: The essential jazz progression
- **Jazz II (III-VI-II-V)**: Extended jazz movement
- **Random**: Algorithmically generated based on music theory principles
- **Custom**: Define your own progression using Roman numerals

### Chord Options

- **Chord Count**: Set the number of chords in your progression (2-16)
- **7th Chords**: Enable to use seventh chords instead of triads
- **+9th/11th**: Enable to use extended chord voicings

### Progression Display

Once generated, your progression shows:
- Chord numbers and names
- Specific notes in each chord
- Musical context information
- Scale reference for the current key

### Playback Controls

- **Play Individual Chords**: Click any chord to hear it
- **Tempo Selection**: Choose from Slow to Very Fast
- **Play Full Progression**: Play through the entire sequence

### Suggested Substitutions

After generating a progression, you'll see suggested modifications:
- **Add Secondary Dominant**: Creates tension pointing to a specific chord
- **Tritone Substitution**: Replaces dominant chords with flat-II7
- **Modal Interchange**: Borrows chords from parallel keys
- **Extended Cadence**: Expands the ending of your progression

These suggestions help you explore more complex harmony and create more interesting transitions between chords.

## Music Theory Concepts

The app incorporates many fundamental music theory concepts:

### Roman Numeral Analysis

Chords are labeled using Roman numerals representing their position in the scale:
- Uppercase (I, IV, V) for major chords
- Lowercase (ii, iii, vi) for minor chords
- Diminished chords marked with ° (vii°)

### Circle of Fifths/Fourths

The app highlights the 5th and 4th relationships, which are crucial for:
- Understanding key relationships
- Recognizing common chord movements
- Planning modulations between keys

### Chord Construction

The app builds chords according to music theory principles:
- **Triads**: Three-note chords (root, third, fifth)
- **Seventh Chords**: Four-note chords adding a seventh above the root
- **Extended Chords**: Additional notes beyond the seventh (9ths, 11ths)

### Chord Qualities

Different chord types create different emotions:
- **Major**: Bright, happy, resolved
- **Minor**: Sad, mysterious, contemplative
- **Diminished**: Tense, unstable, requiring resolution
- **Augmented**: Dreamy, floating, ambiguous
- **Seventh**: Added complexity and tension

## Advanced Techniques

Once you're comfortable with the basics, explore these advanced features:

### Secondary Dominants

These create a temporary "mini key change" that creates tension pointing to a specific chord. For example, V/V means "the dominant of the dominant" – creating emphasis on the V chord.

### Modal Interchange

Borrowing chords from parallel keys (e.g., using chords from C minor in a C major progression) adds emotional color and surprise. Common examples:
- Using the iv chord in a major key progression
- Using bVI or bVII chords from the parallel minor

### Tritone Substitution

Replace a dominant chord with another chord whose root is a tritone (three whole steps) away. This creates a chromatic bass movement while maintaining the tension of the dominant function.

### Voice Leading

Pay attention to how notes move between chords. Good voice leading means:
- Notes move by small intervals when possible
- Common tones stay the same between chords
- Bass notes often move by 4ths, 5ths or step-wise motion

The app's chord playback demonstrates smooth voice leading by default.

## Tips for Songwriters

### Finding the Right Key

- Use the keyboard to try singing along with different root notes
- Find a key that fits your vocal range comfortably

### Emotional Progression Building

- Start with a progression type that matches your intended emotion
- Use modal interchange to add emotional color
- Try both major and minor versions of the same progression

### Genre Exploration

- **Pop**: Try I-V-vi-IV or I-vi-IV-V progressions in major keys
- **Rock**: Experiment with power chords (I-bVII-IV) and modal interchange
- **Jazz**: Start with II-V-I progressions and add extensions
- **Folk**: Simple progressions in major keys with occasional borrowed chords
- **EDM**: Repeated short progressions with emphasis on the tonic and dominant

### Creative Process

1. Generate several progressions and save ones you like to history
2. Try the same progression in different keys and scales
3. Use the substitution suggestions to add variety
4. Play individual chords to create your own custom order

## Offline Usage

The app also supports offline functionality:
- **PWA Support**: Can be installed on your home screen
- **Works Offline**: Continues functioning without internet connection
- **Install Button**: Look for the + icon in the top-right to install

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Computer keyboard shortcuts make the app easier to use:
- **A-L keys**: Play notes (A=C, W=C#, etc.)
- **Space**: Play/stop progression
- **G**: Generate new progression
- **Arrow keys**: Navigate between chords during playback

Enjoy music theory with Sierra's Theory!
